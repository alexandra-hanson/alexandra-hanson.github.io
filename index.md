## About

## Code

I have a private repository that contains my work for the course. It should be shared with Prof. Guy and Dan. The simulation project should be linked at [csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/assignments/project1/simulation/](https://github.com/alexandra-hanson/csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/tree/main/assignments/project1/simulation).

## Credit

As you can tell from the video and project repository, my project was pretty simple and I didn't use any libraries. I used the Proj1_Test.pde file provided with the original download from canvas as a jumping off point for constructing the project, and took inspiration from our in-class activities for how to go about coding the desired behavior.
