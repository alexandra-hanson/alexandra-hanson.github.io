# CSCI 5611: Project 3 -- Optimization-Based Animation

## Group

* Alexandra Hanson (hans7203)

## Attempted features

I have completed the following features:

* Single-arm IK (at least 2D) + Multi-arm IK (at least 2D)
* Moving IK (at least 2D)
* Joint limits
* User Interaction
* Alternative IK Solver

## About (& some reflection)

This is a project for CSCI 5611: Animation and Planning in Games that uses 
optimization based approaches to implement inverse kinemantics for a basic
skeleton.

## Code

I have a private repository that contains my work for the course. It should be 
shared with Prof. Guy and Dan. The code for the "spider" animation should be
linked at 
[csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/assignments/project3/spider/](https://github.com/alexandra-hanson/csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/tree/main/assignments/project3/spider)
and the code for the "walking" animation should be linked at
[csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/assignments/project3/walk/](https://github.com/alexandra-hanson/csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/tree/main/assignments/project3/walk).

## Media

I implemented the following features, which you can see in the two videos below.
