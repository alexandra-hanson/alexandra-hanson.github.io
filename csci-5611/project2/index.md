# CSCI 5611: Project 2 -- Physically-Based Animation with PDEs

## Group

* Alexandra Hanson (hans7203)

## Attempted features

I have completed the following features:

* Multiple Ropes (at least 2D)*
* Cloth Simulation
* 3D Simulation & Rendering
* User Interaction
* SPH Fluid Simulation

## About (& some reflection) -- TO DO

This is a project for CSCI 5611: Animation and Planning in Games that .

## Code

I have a private repository that contains my work for the course. It should be shared with Prof. Guy and Dan. The cloth simulation should be linked at [csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/assignments/project2/cloth/](https://github.com/alexandra-hanson/csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/tree/main/assignments/project2/cloth) and the sph fluid simulation should be linked at [csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/assignments/project2/water/](https://github.com/alexandra-hanson/csci-5611-animation-and-planning-in-games/tree/main/assignments/project2/water).

## Media -- TO DO

I implemented the following features, which you can see in the video below.

| **Component**      | **Timestamps** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Single agent navigation   | 0:16 |
| User Scenario Editing     | 0:07, user adds obstacles by pressing "o" <br> 2:12, user removes obstacles by pressing "p" <br> 0:44, user adds agents by left-clicking <br> 1:34, user removes agents by right-clicking |
| Realtime User Interaction | 1:08, user controls purple obstacle by arrow keys |
| Multiple Agents Planning | 0:50, (also most of the video) |
| Crowd Simulation | 0:34, agents avoid a head-on collision near screen center <br> 0:50, agents avoid angled collision |

## Art Contest Submission -- TO DO

My animations are simple but I still want to submit for the art context.

## Credit -- TO DO

As you can tell from the video and project repository, my project was pretty simple and I didn't use any libraries.
